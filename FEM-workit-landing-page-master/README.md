### What I learned

#### I learned to create multi-layered designs combining ::before and ::after as well as z-index

This challenge involved a pretty tricky effect where you have:
- A section which ends in a divider
- You have an element (the smartphone) that should lay on top of the divider
- And you have these graphical elements in the background which exist in between the section background and the content

Trying to do each of these using a conventional and intuitive method is relatively straightforward. It's combining the 3 at the same time that requires an unconventional approach.

So the solution here involved setting a section::after pseudo-element which is set at 100% height and width. So it will be the same size as the section it's attached to. 

In order get the divider effect we applied border effects (border-radius: 0 0 80% 80%) to get curved bottom.

We then set the ::after pseudo-element to a z-index of minus-1 which allows us to create the layered situation. And we set the section itself to a z-index of one.  

So somehow this produces a layered effect that you wouldn't expect entirely. The content itself (at z-index 1) is above the content of the ::after pseudo element. However, what you wouldn't expect is that the background (color or images) of section ends BEHIND the content of ::after (as if it were a -2 later) 

 



In a "graphical sense", the layers end up like so

>SectionBackground | {-2}

>Section::After | (-1)

>SectionContent | (1)

-* By {-2} I mean that it acts as if it were a -2 in depth.

Next, in order to add graphical elements in the section, you create a ::before. Same logic as the ::after, except we're not setting the z-index on this one. With this the ::before pseudo-element will exist on top of the main section content. In a graphical sense it will act like a level +2 in depth. In graphical terms we get the following:

>SectionBackground | {-2}

>Section::After | (-1)

>SectionContent | (1)

>Section::Before | (2)

Since this will act as if it were a layer on top of the content, we set it to a transparent background to make sure the content behind it is visible. We'll only use this layer to set graphical shapes utilizing background-image.

Note also that since this (::before) is now a layer covering the content-layer, any clickable stuff inside the content layer becomes unclickable. So we have to add a (pointer-events: none) line to the ::after layer, if we want stuff to be clickable on the content-level layer.
